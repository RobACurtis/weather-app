Hello! I have completed the weather-app coding exercise.
It was an enjoyable project and I wanted to include some
thoughts about the design choices I made and other considerations
for the app.

For the frontend, I wanted the application to look similar to other
weather apps on the web. I used bootstrap cards and classes as well as
some custom css to style the application.I also decided to use React
to work with the document object model and give functionality to the
application.

For the structure of the app, I used a postgreSQL database to store
the forecast data and I created a python file which is scheduled to
run everyday at midnight. This file, “get-weather.py” will add to the
database the newest seven day forecast everyday while the server “main.py”
will only send the most recent forecast data to the client.

With more time to work on this application, I would like to consider
what data is displayed on the cards, the API gives a lot of options.
The "description" given by the API is not worded very well, so some
thought could go into how to describe the predicted weather according
to the information from the API.

I would also like to include more functionality for the current day.
Some ideas I have would be to make use of the minute forecast or hourly
forecast to constantly update the current day's weather information.
Another consideration would be giving the user the option to enter
specific coordinates to allow them to see the weather for any place they
desire. I also would like to give more options for the icons that display
according to the forecasted weather.
